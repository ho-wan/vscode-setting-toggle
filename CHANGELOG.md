## [1.5.1] (14 December 2021)
- Language specific settings can now be toggled using the following syntax:
`"toggle.settingTitle": "[terraform]editor.codeLens",`

## [1.5.0] (13 December 2021)
- Add all 3 toggle settings to status bar, which can be clicked to toggle each one. By default, only the primary is shown, `settings.json` can be used to configure if each toggle is shown in status bar or not. State of boolean toggles will be shown as (T) or (F).

## [1.4.1] (06 June 2021)
